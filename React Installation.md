# React Setup
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Meta (*Facebook*). It's one of the most popular javascript libraries. 

## Components
- React it's all about components, and think about them as independent chunks of user interfaces components. They can be as small or big as we want it.
- Components can be reusable as lego blocks, and with them you can build more complex apps.
- They help to increase the speed and the User Experience as well.
