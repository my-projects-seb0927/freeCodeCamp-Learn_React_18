# React Setup
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It was developed by Meta (*Facebook*). It's one of the most popular javascript libraries. 

## Components
- React it's all about components, and think about them as independent chunks of user interfaces components. They can be as small or big as we want it.
- Components can be reusable as lego blocks, and with them you can build more complex apps.
- They help to increase the speed and the User Experience as well.

## Requirements
- HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Workflow
You need: A Web Browser, Text Editor (VS Code), NodeJS and Vite

## How to start
1. Go to your terminal and type `npx create-react-app my-app` inside the folder you want to start your React Project.
2. Open the folder where you started you React Project in VS Code.
3. Open the integrated terminal in VS Code.
4. Type `npm start`. This will start our React Application.
    > Every time you make a change in your code and save, you will see the latest version in the browser.

And let's start :)
